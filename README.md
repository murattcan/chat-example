# Socket.io Chat Example

This code is an improvement over the example [Get Started: Chat application](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) on the socket.io website.

## Improvements
From their website:

> Here are some ideas to improve the application:
> - [ ] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
> - [ ] Add support for nicknames
> - [ ] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
> - [ ] Add “{user} is typing” functionality
> - [ ] Show who’s online
> - [ ] Add private messaging
> - [x] Share your improvements!
